INTRODUCTION
------------

Enhancement for handling multi-currency in Drupal 8 for Drupal Commerce.

Drupal Commerce 2 supports multiple currencies out of the box.
But only for adding prices, not resolving multiple currency prices/orders
based on some criteria.

Commerce currency resolver tries to solve resolving prices per currency,
calculating those prices and exchange rates between currencies.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires Commerce Exchanger, Drupal Commerce 2
and it's submodule price.


INSTALLATION
------------

any Drupal contrib module.

       Resolver module.

                   > Currency resolver.
    3. Choose from available options settings to configure how currency should
       be resolved, how prices are calculated and default currency.

COMMERCE SHIPPING
--------------

If you are using commerce shipping there are two options how shipping methods
can be set to work with currency resolver.

* If you are using condition _Order currency_ and the selected currency matches to the price currency selected
  under _Rate amount_ then you don't need to do anything.
* If you need to auto-calculate price or have multiple prices per shipping method
  you need enable submodule _commerce_currency_resolver_shipping_.


EXAMPLES
-----------

### Adding order item programmatically
If you are adding order items programmatically in your code,
you need take in account possible conflicts with prices. To avoid that
is best that you using resolver to resolve prices for certain item to the cart.

Example below shows entire process in custom add to cart process, where we add
item to the cart.

```
**
@var \Drupal\commerce_cart\CartManagerInterface $cart_manager */
$cart_manager = \Drupal::service('commerce_cart.cart_manager');

/** @var \Drupal\commerce_order\Resolver\OrderTypeResolverInterface $order_type_resolver */
$order_type_resolver = \Drupal::service('commerce_order.chain_order_type_resolver');

/** @var \Drupal\commerce_store\CurrentStoreInterface $current_store */
$current_store = \Drupal::service('commerce_store.current_store');

/** @var \Drupal\commerce_cart\CartProviderInterface $cart_provider */
$cart_provider = \Drupal::service('commerce_cart.cart_provider');

/** @var \Drupal\commerce_order\OrderItemStorage $order_item_storage */
$order_item_storage = \Drupal::service('entity_type.manager')->getStorage('commerce_order_item');
$store = $current_store->getStore();

$context = $context = new Context(\Drupal::currentUser(), $store);
$resolved_price = \Drupal::service('commerce_currency_resolver.price_resolver')->resolve($product, 1, $context);
$order_item = $order_item_storage->createFromPurchasableEntity($product, ['unit_price' => $resolved_price]);

$order_type_id = $order_type_resolver->resolve($order_item);

$cart = $cart_provider->getCart($order_type_id, $store);
if (!$cart) {
  $cart = $cart_provider->createCart($order_type_id, $store);
}

$cart_manager->addOrderItem($cart, $order_item);
```
